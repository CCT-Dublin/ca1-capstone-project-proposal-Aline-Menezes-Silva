Introduction

The aviation industry is essential for global transportation. Helping economies grow by connecting people, businesses and goods. Irish airports are key hubs for international trade and travel. Where tourism and aviation sectors are closely connected and rely on each other. Tourism depends on air travel to attract visitors, while airlines need tourists to fill their seats. This relationship is crucial for facilitating trade, investment and particularly tourism, which is Ireland's largest native industry, representing 13% of all jobs and serving as the biggest employer in many regions (THE IMPORTANCE OF AVIATION TO IRISH TOURISM, 2024). 
This project aims to use predictive analytics to forecast future demand for passengers, freight, and commercial flights at Irish airports. Using historical data, the goal is to create models that can predict trends in air travel, helping with airport operations, resource planning and strategic decisions.
The capstone project addresses real-world challenges such as fluctuating passenger numbers, seasonal variations and the increasing demand for cargo transportation. By developing predictive models, the project can assist in improving operational efficiency, optimizing airport infrastructure and offering data-driven insights for decision-making.
